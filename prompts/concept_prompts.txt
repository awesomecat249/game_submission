You are required to vibe code a game using any LLMs that you find suitable to achieve the goals. The aim is to deliver a complete web game that fits the theme:

The game should take the form of a board game, card game, dice game, or any game topic of simple web game format.
The gameplay mechanics must directly connect to the chosen social issue, making the game both educational and engaging.
Suggested themes may include (but are not limited to):
Climate change & sustainability
Access to education
Mental health & wellbeing
Social equity & inclusion
Community resilience
So on
Contestants need to decide on topics that suit their local context (either Vietnam or Australia).

Game Requirements
Your game must include at least the following screens/views:

Menu
Play
Please free to add other approriate screens as you would like.

Additional guidelines:

The game must be in 2D. (Optional: or 3D if your team is able.)
Game assets (sprites, backgrounds, sound effects, code logics, etc.) can also be generated using your choices of AI models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Nano Banana, Sora, â€¦, where appropriate.
The game must only use HTML, CSS and Javascript. Feel free to use any HTML, CSS and JavaScript libraries/frameworks as long as it can run fully on the browser (only on front-end) without a need to install any additional installation or setup or backend.
You can use any AI platform, extension, website or service to help you to create this game.


I have an idea for a game: you play as a man in his late 20s living a dull life. Your job is to brighten his life by making new relationships, decorating your house, etc. Outline the full gameplay flow

expand furhter, add more events, characters, endings, make the process of him regaining the light in his life slower
