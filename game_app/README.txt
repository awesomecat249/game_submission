Color My Life v3 â€” Prototype
============================
Features:
- Gender-selectable romance (Linh or Alex)
- Animated portraits (CSS animations + SVG thumbnails)
- 3 save slots (localStorage) with thumbnail previews
- Sound effects (WebAudio) and simple chime
- Visual mood changes and particle overlay
- Fully front-end; open index.html in browser to play

How to run:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
3. Use New Game to start and pick 'linh' or 'alex' when prompted.
4. Save/Load using Save Slot / Load Slot buttons (uses localStorage).

Notes:
- This prototype uses simple generated SVG portraits and WebAudio for SFX to keep the package self-contained.
- For production, replace SVGs with higher-quality art and add pre-recorded audio files.
